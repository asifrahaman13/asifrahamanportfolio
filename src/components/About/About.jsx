          Hello visitor! Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Asif
          Rahaman, and I am a second-year student at IIT Bhilai. I am pursuing
          Electrical Engineering. Currently, I am in my second year. I am a
          coding geek who likes to spend most of my time coding. I code for fun
          and to learn the latest amazing technologies. I passed class 10 from
          LMET International School and class 12 from Prabharani Public School.
          Both of them are in Berhmapore, and both of them come under CBSE.
          <p />
          <br />
          I spend a good amount of my time reading books. I read books from
          almost all kinds of domains. Among all horror, my favorites are
          science fiction, psychological thrillers, and adventures. I never miss
          the stories of Sunday suspense, and I frequently listen to the stories
          by radio 98.4 Mirchi Bangle.(I am from West Bengal). I read spiritual
          books, too, like Quran, Mahabharat, the bible, etc. This gives me
          inner satisfaction and boosts my confidence. I am an agonist, and I
          sincerely thank GOD for all his creation.:)
          <p />
          <br />I love playing sports. I occasionally play football, cricket,
          tennis, etc. Among all, football is my favorite. However, due to my
          busy schedule, I am not able to play them:(
